Share your Geometry Dash level completions/verifications in as few clicks as possible. Platforms include:

- <cj>Twitter</c>
- <cl>Bluesky</c>
- <co>r/geometrydash</c>
- <ca>Mastodon</c> instances of your choice (<ca>mastodon.social</c> by default)
- <cr>[Windows/macOS ONLY]</c> <cb>Discord</c> (choose the <cb>Discord</c> app to open in mod settings)
- <cy>Any website of your own! (Preferably a website that is SFW and geared towards making posts, but I can't stop you.)</c>

<cy>(While WarbledCompletions works and is available on Android, all buttons open in your preferred web browser.)</c>

WarbledCompletions also comes with a screenshot shortcut button in case you want to get an in-game screenshot while playing in Windowed mode.

- For <c-00adef>Windows</c> and <cg>Android</c> users, the mod will prompt you to open the folder containing your screenshot, because copying images to your clipboard is a lot harder to accomplish than it sounds.
- For <c-cdcdcd>macOS</c> <c-2e88d6>Seq</c><c-f7a865>uoia</c> (or lower) users, you can hold the <c-2e88d6>SHI</c><c-f7a865>FT</c> key while pressing the screenshot shortcut button to take a screenshot that gets sent directly to your clipboard.<c>*</c>

<cy>*: For macOS users, a full game restart may be required, so don't wait until you finish an Extreme Demon to use the screenshot shortcut button.

Everything is done on-device.</c>
