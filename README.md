Share your Geometry Dash level completions/verifications in as few clicks as possible. Platforms include:

- <cj>Twitter</c>
- <cl>Bluesky</c>
- <co>r/geometrydash</c> (with several <co>Rule 3</c> guardrails)
- <ca>Mastodon</c> instances of your choice (<ca>mastodon.social</c> by default)
- <cr>[Windows/macOS ONLY]</c> <cb>Discord</c> (choose the <cb>Discord</c> app to open in mod settings)
- <cy>Any website of your own! (Preferably a website that is SFW and geared towards making posts, but I can't stop you.)</c>

WarbledCompletions also comes with a screenshot shortcut in case you want to get an in-game screenshot while playing in Windowed mode. The mod will prompt you to open the folder containing your screenshot, because copying images to your clipboard is a lot harder to accomplish than it sounds.
